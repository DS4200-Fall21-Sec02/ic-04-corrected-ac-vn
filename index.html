      This is our first visualization, a scatter plot.
      The dataset's elements were selected from a random set of data points we encountered online. The dataset examines whether there 
      exists a correleation between the number of plants and fish in a certain pond. Since the number of fish and plants seem pretty 
      uncorrelated on the surface and the objective is to discover whether there exists some correlation, we felt that a scatterplot would 
      best serve our purpose. A scatter plot plots two independent attributes against each other, which is exactly what we need to do in order to
      spot a potential correlation. <br>

      This is our second visualization, a grouped bar chart. The dataset describes restaurants in Boston through features like a rating and their
      distance from Northeastern's campus. We chose to use this dataset because the data is original and relevant to ourselves. A grouped bar chart is an appropriate encoding because it
      groups data by each restaurant, and is able to use sub-groups, individual bars, to represent the two features. The two features are
      also differentiated by color; red bars show the rating and blue bars show their distance. Hover the mouse over the bars and hold it to 
        read their values.<br>
